# 1) Setup the soft links to the analysis scripts, collect_energies.py  energy-decomposition.py  process-energies-frames.py
# 2) Setup the soft links to the simulation to analyse SYSTEM.top, SYSTEM.crd, TRAJ.dcd
# 3) First load sire because we need a python that has mdtraj installed
module load sire/dev
# 4) Run this script to parallelize the trajectory analysis. 
# The syntax below indicates that:
# - we will compute the interaction energy of residue 1 (first residue in the topology). 
# - There will 10 jobs 
# - The jobs will run on a queue (hardcoded inside the script to be the slurm serial queue of section6)
# - Only the first 100 frames will be considered
# - The analysis will skip every other framee (so will do 0,2,4,6,8,10,...,98 we count from 0) 
python process-energies-frames.py 1 10 queue 100 2
# 5) If you wish to analyse all frames in the trajectory, using 10 serial jobs, without skipping any then just type
python process-energies-frames.py 1 10 queue
# The more jobs you use, the fewer frames per job, the faster the analysis will complete. 
# The above script automatically submit multiple instances of the script energy-decomposition.py , each via a separate job
# 6) When all jobs have completed the results will be stored in python pickles in the folder 'energies-X' where X is the residue number
# Assuming we analysed residue 1, the data is collected by running 
python collect_energies.py energies-1
# Running this script will write to the standard output a table

      1	 Ternal	    1.91	+-	2.57                   
 ---> This is the average internal energy of the residue and the standard deviation. 
      The data comes from the distribution of chunks files in the energies folder.
