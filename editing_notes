Running process-energies-frames.py now works with energy-decomposition.py
collect-energies.py doesn't work anymore as some error due to the dictionary containing a list: will work on this next. 
Instead, can use collect_lists_V3.py (run as before $ collect_lists_V3.py energies-x) which will create folder "all_data_residue_X" which contains a file with each residue energy at each step. 

update:
all now work using process-energies-frames.py - then use collect_lists_V5.py : this creates a folder "all_data_residue_X" which contains a file with a histogram for each residue. Will write another script to compute KL between systems.
