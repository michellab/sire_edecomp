Obtain energy data
------------------
process-energies-frames gives folder as energies-x. 
Then run collect_energies to give data in all_data_residue_x (with dictionary key as filename)
Use file_move.sh to separate results into different folders for CLJ, LJ and Coulomb
use file_rename.py to rename all files


Run Multiple residues
---------------------
to group residues: Use Run_combine_residue_interactions.sh , which runs Combine_residue_interactions.py for the range of residues selected.


Computing KL
------------
create soft links to folders which contain all energies (if running from elsewhere)
script_run_all_KL to compute KL (make a folder to put all these values - edit path in this file)
collate_KL values then to make a list of KL. Will add a value for the "missing" residue (as there is no energies computed for the residue which is selected)
